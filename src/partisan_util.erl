%% @doc Convert a list of elements into an N-ary tree. This conversion
%%      works by treating the list as an array-based tree where, for
%%      example in a binary 2-ary tree, a node at index i has children
%%      2i and 2i+1. The conversion also supports a "cycles" mode where
%%      the array is logically wrapped around to ensure leaf nodes also
%%      have children by giving them backedges to other elements.
